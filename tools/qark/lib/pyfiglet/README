SYNOPSIS

	pyfiglet is a full port of FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure
	python. It takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like
	the title above, which is the 'block' font).

FAQ

	Q. Why? WHY?!
	A. I was bored. Really bored.

	Q. What the hell does this do that FIGlet doesn't?
	A. Not much, except allow your font collection to live
           in one big zipfile. The point of this code is to embed
           dynamic figlet rendering in Python without having to
           execute an external program, although it operates on the
           commandline as well.  See below for USAGE details. You can
           think of this as a python FIGlet driver.

	Q. Does this support kerning/smushing like FIGlet?
	A. Yes, yes it does. Output should be identical to FIGlet. If
           not, this is a bug, which you should report to me!

	Q. Can I use/modify/redstribute this code?
	A. Yes, under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE below).

	Q. I improved this code, what should I do with it?
	A. You can mail patches to <cjones@insub.org>. Particularly bugfixes.
           If you make changes to the kerning/mushing/rendering portion, PLEASE
           test it throroughly. The code is fragile and complex.


USAGE

	You can use pyfiglet in one of two ways. First, it operates on the
	commandline as C figlet does and supports most of the same options.
	Run with --help to see a full list of tweaks.  Mostly you will only
	use -f to change the font. It defaults to standard.flf.

	tools/pyfiglet 'text to render'

	Pyfiglet is also a library that can be used in python code:

	from pyfiglet import Figlet
	f = Figlet(font='slant')
	print f.renderText('text to render')


AUTHOR

	pyfiglet is a *port* of FIGlet, and much of the code is directly translated
	from the C source. I optimized some bits where I could, but because the smushing
	and kerning code is so incredibly complex, it was safer and easier to port the logic
	almost exactly.  Therefore, I can't really take much credit for authorship, just
	translation. The original authors of FIGlet are listed on their website  at
	http://www.figlet.org/.

	The Python port was done by Christopher Jones <cjones@insub.org> (http://gruntle.org/).
	It is currently maintained by Peter Waller (p@pwaller.net, github:pwaller)

THANKS
