ISSUES - APP COMPONENT ATTACK SURFACE
WARNING - The backup element is not specified in the manifest, which therefore defaults to true. Potential for data theft via local attacks via adb backup, if the device has USB debugging enabled (not common). More info: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup
POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY - The android:debuggable flag is manually set to true in the AndroidManifest.xml. This will cause your application to be debuggable in production builds and can result in data leakage and other security issues. It is not necessary to set the android:debuggable flag in the manifest, it will be set appropriately automatically by the tools. More info: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#debug

ISSUES - ADB EXPLOIT COMMANDS
INFO - Until we perfect this, for manually testing, run the following command to see all the options and their meanings: adb shell am. Make sure to update qark frequently to get all the enhancements!
